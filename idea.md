- **Calendar Assistant**
    
    You can build a web or mobile interface for this project. If you decide to build a web interface, use React. If you decide to build a mobile interface, use Expo. Through this interface, a user should be able to authenticate a GSuite account, which should be used to pull calendar information. Display this calendar information in a way that makes sense.
    
    Then, there should be a simple chat interface that allows the user to chat with their calendar agent. The user should be able to say things like “I have three meetings I need to schedule with Joe, Dan, and Sally. I really want to block my mornings off to work out, so can you write me an email draft I can share with each of them?” and “How much of my time am I spending in meetings? How would you recommend I decrease that?”


    It has the richest problem space for demonstrating LLM capabilities (understanding context, multi-step reasoning, different output formats)
The natural language to structured actions pipeline is a core skill for AI products
You can show both technical chops (OAuth, calendar API integration, state management) and product sense (what makes a good calendar agent)
It's the most directly applicable to real-world AI assistant products
